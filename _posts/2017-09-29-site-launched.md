It's time to learn something new and document it along the way. I've decided to use GitHub for this purpose and created the [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) powered homepage for this purpose.

I'll start publishing any projects and notebooks in GitHub as a portfolio while I'm learning.

The first layout and design is from this great little [tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
